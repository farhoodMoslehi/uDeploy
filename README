This Python program was created to look at a uDeploy agent in either a Linux or Windows environemnt and do the following
Tasks:

1) Get the Installed.properties and the agent.out files
2) Restart an offline uDeploy agent
3) Replace any line within the installed.properties files

The main reason for this script is to troubleshoot uDeploy agents through a server automation system like HPSA or BladeLogic.
These tools exists in large enterprises in order to access systems without providing a complete access to engineers.
Furthermore, the script can be run on many servers in parallel, and processes can be automated.
